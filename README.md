**Project Title:** Grocery list.                
          
                               
**Project Description:**    
          
A single-page web application that allows users to add/remove products in a grocery table. After creating a grocery list, users can print it.           
          
                                
**Project Objectives:**    
                  
- Use DOM & BOM properties, methods, and techniques to create a web application that provides a dynamic user experience.       
- Demonstrate proficiency with event-driven programming and DOM events.       
- Implement basic form validation using any combination of built-in HTML validation attributes and DOM-event-driven JavaScript validation.           
        
                                            
**The project meets technical requirements listed below:**    
                              
- The getElementById() and querySelector methods were used to cache elements.      
- The parent-child-sibling relationships were used to navigate between elements (parentElement property).     
- For loop was used to iterate over a collection of elements (rows) to increment the product quantity in the product table.          
- The createElement() method was used to create table cells.        
- The appendChild() method was used to add new elements to the DOM (to append cells to rows and append rows to the table body).         
- The DocumentFragment interface or HTML templating with the cloneNode method was used to create templated content (an additional <td> element (remove column) in the grocery table was created).        
- The innerHTML, innerText, and textContent DOM properties were used to modify elements in response to user interaction.            
- The style property was used to modify the style of an element in response to user interactions (to hide the last table column in the print window).            
- The value attribute of the input element in response to user interaction was modified (when the user clicks the “Add” button, the product input field is cleared out).              
- Two event listeners (for “click” and ”keypress” events) were registered and the associated event handler functions were created.              
- Two BOM methods were used (window.open() and setTimeout()).                
- Form for product input was created, event-based validations (for “click” and ”keypress” events) were included (“Product name should not be blank” validation), HTML attribute validation was included (required placeholder).
